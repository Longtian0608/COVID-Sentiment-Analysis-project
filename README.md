# Study on the Change of Peopleâ€™s Sentiments Towards COVID-19 and Its Influencing Factors Based on NLP Technology

## Brief description
This is a collaborative data science project where we attempted to explore the relationship between the stringency of government policy and people's sentiments
towards the Covid pandemic. A key to to this project is to perform sentiment analysis. We extracted large dataset related to Covid-19 tweets and used basic natural 
language processing techniques for data cleaning. The processed text data can then be fed into the neural network model we created to predict the overall sentiment 
score of the tweet from 0-1(negative to positive).
